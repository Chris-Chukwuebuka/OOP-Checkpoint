This code base contains an object-oriented programming (OOP) implementation of a shopping cart. The shopping cart allows users to add items, remove items, and calculate the total price of their purchases.

## Features

- Add items to the shopping cart
- Remove items from the shopping cart
- Calculate the total price of the items in the shopping cart

## Getting Started

To use the shopping cart, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/OOP-shopping-cart.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd OOP-shopping-cart`
3. Run the application: `python shopping_cart.py`

## Usage

The shopping cart provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with the cart. Here are the available commands:

- `add`: Add an item to the shopping cart. Usage: `add <item_name> <price>`
- `remove`: Remove an item from the shopping cart. Usage: `remove <item_name>`
- `total`: Calculate the total price of the items in the shopping cart. Usage: `total`
- `exit`: Exit the application

## Example

```
$ 
Welcome to the shopping cart!

> add apple 0.99
